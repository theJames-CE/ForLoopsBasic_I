# ForLoopsBasic_I

<h1>Assignment: For Loops: Basic I</h1>

<p><b>Welcome to your first Core assignment of Python!</b> Some students like to explore the assignments before they're finished reading through the lessons, and that's okay! It can be good for your brain to have a preview of what your future challenges might be. However, before you begin this assignment, it's important that you've first:</p>

<li>Completed the preceding lesson modules</li>
<li>Taken the knowledge checks to confirm your understanding</li>
<li>Viewed lecture material related to the assignment topics</li>
<li>Completed and submitted your practice assignments</li>

<h2>Now, for the Core Assignment:</h2>

Create a Python file called for_loop_basic1.py that performs the following tasks.

<b>Basic</b> - Print all integers from 0 to 150.

<b>Multiples of Five</b> - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000

<b>Counting, the Dojo Way</b> - Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If divisible by 10, print "Coding Dojo".

<b>Whoa. That Sucker's Huge</b> - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.

<b>Countdown by Fours</b> - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.

<b>Flexible Counter</b> - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)
